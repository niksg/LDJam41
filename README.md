Game for Ludum Dare 41 [April 22, 2018]

Didn't super realize open sourcing was a part of this game jam even though I have done like 9 of them. Oh well here it is!
You can probably tell when and where I was running out of time and sleep. 30 hours is not a long time to make a game.

This was fun. Thanks for reading this.
